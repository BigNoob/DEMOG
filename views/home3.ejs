				<p> Thank you for testing this video game! Your feedback will greatly help us improve the game.</p>

				<p>This game is a <span class="bold">two player</span> game: when you click on "Enter waiting room" below, you will be on hold until another Mturker connects to play the game. It shouldn't take more than a minute or so. </p>

				<p class="bold">The goal of the game is to pop all the balloons by jumping on the seesaw. On the screenshot below, you will control one of the two characters at the bottom. When you are not in the air, move the seesaw by pressing the "left" and "right" keys so that the other player lands on the seesaw.</p>
				
				<img class="centered" width="700px" src="../public/images/screenshot_space3.png" />

				<p class="bold">Each time a player pops a balloon, the loot in the red balloon increases. The red balloon will be caught last, and the player who catches it will be able to share the loot before all players can go on to the next game.</p>

				<p>When all games are over, you will be redirected to a form to leave your feedback about the game: help us improve it by leaving constructive (positive or negative) feedback!</p>

				<p><span class="bold">You will be paid $0.25 for just participating in the game PLUS your earnings across all games: 100 points are worth 10 cents.</span> We automatically save your points at the end of the game. Payments will be made through Amazon in the next 48 hours.</p>				

				<p>At the beginning of the game, you will have to enter your Mturk id - this is how we know who to pay so do not forget to fill the field. Besides, if you quit before the end of the game, we won't be able to pay you. </p>
