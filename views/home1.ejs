				<p> Thank you for testing this video game! Your feedback will greatly help us improve the game.</p>

				<p>This game is a <span class="bold">two player</span> game: when you click on "Enter waiting room" below, you will be on hold until another Mturker connects to play the game. It shouldn't take more than a minute or so. </p>

				<p class="bold">The goal of the game is to kill all the enemy spaceships by pressing the "space" key to shoot and "left" and "right" keys to move. On the screenshot below, you will control either the red or purple spaceship at the bottom, and the other player will control the other spaceship.</p>

				<img class="centered" width="700px" src="../public/images/screenshot_space1.png" />

				<p class="bold">Each time a player shoots an enemy spaceship, the loot in the mothership increases. The mothership will be killed last: it will then fall and the player closer to it will be able to grab the loot and share it, before all players can go on to the next game.</p>

				<p>When all games are over, you will be redirected to a form to leave your feedback about the game: help us improve it by leaving constructive (positive or negative) feedback!</p>
				
				<p><span class="bold">You will be paid $0.25 for just participating in the game PLUS your earnings across all games: 100 points are worth 10 cents.</span> We automatically save your points at the end of the game. Payments will be made through Mturk in the next 48 hours.</p>

				<p>At the beginning of the game, you will have to enter your Mturk id - this is how we know who to pay so do not forget to fill the field. Besides, if you quit before the end of the game, we won't be able to pay you. </p>
